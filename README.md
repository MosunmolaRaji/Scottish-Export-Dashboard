# Scottish-Export-Dashboard
Analysis and visualisation of Scottish exports from 2002 to 2018 to various destinations
In this project, I cleaned the Scottish export data from the year 2002 through to 2018 using power query, analysed using pivot tables and designed an interactive dasboard using charts from the pivot table, slicers and timeline.
